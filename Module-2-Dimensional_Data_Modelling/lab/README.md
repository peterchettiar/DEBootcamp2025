## Data Modelling - Cumulative Dimensions, Struct and Array

The main table we wiil be looking at today is `player_seasons`. You would have realised that it is actually a large temporal dataset (i.e. one player has multiple records - each representing a season). Let's take `Aaron McKie` as an example:

<img width="1639" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca029ca-6b96-4339-89e1-df9a7500e036" />

Here you can see that the first few columns up to the column `gp` the values of each record are the same, only after that then the season statistics vary for each season. The issue for keeping the table as is is that if you join this table with another one (e.g. `games` or `teams`) that does not have this temporal granularity, the system needs to shuffle data across nodes to align the different granularity of data, and this can be an expensive operation in distributed systems leading to slower performance and loss of compression. This is also known as the `temporal problem`.

> Note: Compression loss happens because repeated values (like `player_name` become less effective at compressing when they are split across many rows instead of grouped.

ðŸ§  **The Solution: One record per player with an array of seasons**
Instead of keeping one row per season, group all of a player's seasons into an array like this:

| player_name | seasons                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A       | [{"season":2020, "team":"A", "points":1500}, {"season":2021, "team":"A", "points":1600}] |
| B       | [{"season":2020, "team":"B", "points":1700}]                             |

This way:
- You have one row per player, removing the "temporal" spread.
- The seasonal data is nested in an array (e.g. JSON-like structure)
- Joins with other tables are now faster, more efficient, and preserve compression.

### Creating an Array of Structs

To create the array of seasons, which is essentially an `ARRAY` of `STRUCTS`, we can create a composite type in PostgreSQL (also called a user-defined type) - it allows you to define a custom data structure with multiple fields. You can think of it as building an object (instance of a class) in Python. You can define the `season_stats` STRUCT, which is its own data type, in SQL as:
```sql
CREATE TYPE season_stats AS (
  season INTEGER,
  age TEXT,
  gp INTEGER,
  pts REAL,
  reb REAL,
  ast REAL
);
```
