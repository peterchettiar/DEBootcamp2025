# Data Engineering Bootcamp - Day 0 Set Up

In this section, we will be going through the [Bootcamp Orientation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ng5juIg7LY&t=8s), specifically the software setups needed for the course. The main ones we would be looking at are:
1. [`DOCKER + COMPOSE`](#docker-and-docker-compose)
2. `POSTGRES + PGADMIN SETUP`
3. `POSTGRES RUN IN DOCKER`
4. `DBEAVER` - SQL editor (other editors can be used based on your preference)
5. `PYTHON` - Version 3.11 and above

>[!TIP]
>If you decide to pursue the course using a `Virtual Machine` instead of a local development approach, then this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/peterchettiar/6e719cd2bbdb3e6aae4e6d1895670687) can provide a detailed setup of your virtual machine instance using GCP as cloud providedr, install a full anaconda distribution (this would make sure that `python` is installed into the VM), as well as installing `docker` and `docker compose`.
